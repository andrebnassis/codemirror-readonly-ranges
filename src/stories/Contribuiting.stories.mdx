# Contributing

If you want to start contributing for `CodeMirror ReadOnly Ranges Extension`, read the documentation below to understand more about the project structure and its directives.

## Scripts
Install the project using `yarn` 

### Build the project locally
```bash
yarn build:lib  #Generate a /dist folder.
```

## Test Library built:

To test your built package we need to go through 2 steps.

- Step 1: Install the built package on a target project
  - You can choose between 2 methods:
    - Method A: Linking the built package to a target project
    - \[**BEST**\] Method B: Publishing to a private registry using Docker + Verdaccio
- Step 2: Using the library on the target project

### Step1
#### Method A) Linking the built package to a target project

A.1) After running `yarn build:lib`, on terminal, run:

`yarn link`

It will create a local link of the library named as "codemirror-readonly-ranges" (so you can use it on your target project)

A.2) Inside your target project:

- On terminal, run:

```bash
yarn link "codemirror-readonly-ranges"

```
It will allows you to use the generated link on step 1 inside the target project.

#### Method B) Publishing to a private registry using Docker + Verdaccio

B.1) Publish the Package
```bash
yarn verdaccio:publish
```
PS: You can enter on `http://localhost:4873/` to check the package published.

Troubleshoot:

- If you are having some permission issue:
On the project root folder, run:
```bash
sudo chown -R 10001:65533 /verdaccio
```

Some command tips:

 - Stop the container:
```bash
yarn verdaccio:down
```

 - Check container files 
```bash
docker exec -it verdaccio /bin/sh
#then you can execute bash commands such as 'ls -a'
```

 - Check container logs
```bash
docker logs verdaccio
```

B.2) On the `target project`:

First, you need to install the published package. There is two ways to do it, let me show you:  
(Choose the one that fits best for you)  

Way 01: Configure `.npmrc` and install the library and its dependencies.

  - Create `.npmrc` file with the following content:
  
```bash
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
codemirror-readonly-ranges:registry=http://localhost:4873
```

> PS: `Way 01` is the best option because automatic identifies when to download from verdaccio's registry, so if you publish many times you just need to run `yarn` or `npm install` to update the `codemirror-readonly-ranges` package (instead of manually ask to download it from verdaccio's registry).


Way 02: Install the package pointing directly to verdaccio's registry, then install the related dependencies.
  
  -  Install the package pointing directly to verdaccio's registry
```bash
yarn add codemirror-readonly-ranges --registry http://localhost:4873
```
